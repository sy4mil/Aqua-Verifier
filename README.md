### Overview

Aqua Verifier is a simple WordPress plugin that modifies the default user registration page by adding a verification form using the [Envato Market API](http://themeforest.net/help/api).

Coupled with BBPress plugin, this will allow you to easily create your own Support Forum while still having all the default functionalities of the registration form that everyone is already familiar with.

### Server requirements
Because we make good use of PHP namespaces, your server should support at least PHP 5.3, but any newer version would work just fine.

### License

Aqua Verifier is released under GPLv3 - [http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html](http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html). You are free to redistribute & modify the plugin in either free or commercial products. Please kindly keep all links & credits intact.
